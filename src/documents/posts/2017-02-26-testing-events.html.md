  <t render="markdown">
  Previously, I wrote an [article](/2017/02/12/better-event-handling-in-episerver/) how to handle events in the Episerver but I did not show how to test those. I am fan of the Test Driven Development but when working with the Episerver it is quite hard to test the code including .NET event testing. Developers tend to not write unit tests for those. In this article, I will show that this is quite easy when using the right tools.
